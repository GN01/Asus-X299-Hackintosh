EFI-Folder distributions separated by motherboard for validated working systems.

It is recommended to add device properties for your specific motherboard.
I.E: Sage/10G users use the WS X299 Sage 10G folder and copy the device properties from 'DJ7_ASUS_WS_SAGE10G_Properties.zip' to your OpenCore EFI folder and config.plist
